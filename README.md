# HangmanGame
This is a terminal based game I created as part of a Python Bootcamp Class @ Hackbright Academy in San Francsico. 
The game is a pirate themed version of the classic hangman game.

# Topics Include: 

- Variables
- Types
- Operations

- Strings
- Sets
- Input
- If, elif, else statements

- Functions

# How to play the game: 

Run the game in Python 3 using your favaorite IDE. 

Guess the name of the Pirate's parrot and you won't have to walk the plank. 
Guess incorrectly and take one step forward to your doom.
